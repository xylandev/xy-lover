# Your Memories Here

This is the folder where the Christmas Tree looks for your photos.

### Instructions:
1.  **Upload your photos** into this folder.
2.  **Rename them** to numbers:
    *   `1.jpg`
    *   `2.jpg`
    *   ...
    *   `31.jpg`

### Notes:
*   **Format**: JPG is recommended.
*   **Size**: Vertical (Portrait) photos look best.
*   **Missing Files**: If you upload fewer than 31 photos (e.g., only 1.jpg to 5.jpg), the app will automatically fill the remaining spots with random internet images.
